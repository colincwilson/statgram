"Grid formalism makes it possible to characterize the nonlocal patterns described above in local terms" (p. 408).

Eastern Cheremis type stress pattern (Hayes 1995:sec. 7.2)
    (15) unbounded stress pattern
    "default to opposite" - "rightmost heavy, else initial"

        main    *##                 Culminativity
        stress  *[+main][]          End Rule Right
        default *[-str,+heavy]      Weight-to-Stress
        default *[-str]             Every word must begin with stress
        default *[][+str,-heavy]    Light syllables may be stressed only if initial

empirical typology of quantity-insensitive systems compiled by Gordon (2002)
    33 observed stress patterns
    all legal patterns up to eight syllables in the training sets
    some minor corrections to Gordon's materials
    tested learned grammars by examining all possible strings of length 8 or less composed of (syll-unstressed, syll-secondary.stress, syll-primary.stress)
